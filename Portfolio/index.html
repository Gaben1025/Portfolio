        <p> I've been very passionate about programming since I was little. Both of my parents were
          programmers and it inspired me to follow that career path myself. I have been studying Computer Science since
          I was in high school and just recently graduated from Temple University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.
          During my time there, I built my portfolio by doing both solo and group projects. For my final two group
          projects, I was the tech lead where I learned how to both work within a big group and also how to lead these
          said groups. Going forward I want to learn and put into practice new design patterns, I also want to learn how
          to use databases and unit testing more efficiently so I can improve my skills as a Software Engineer and
          overall be a great asset to any team im a part of in the future. </p>
